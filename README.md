# Resume-builder
Helping people build their portfolio and deploy them quickly in Github Pages

## Features built till present
1. Text and Image element -> Draggable and Moveable (by holding Ctrl key)
2. Edit text element with respect to font size, font type, color, indentation and BIU
3. Add hyperlinks to any element using the button.
4. Delete button to delete any element.

## Bugs to fix
1. Currently, the font types aren't working as expected. All the fonts look the same.
2. Text related changes are currently for the entire text element rather than individual text which has to be fixed. 3
3. Once an element has a hyperlink, it is difficult to edit the text/image element as clicking on it takes you to that link. Temp Fix is to remove hyperlink, edit the element and put it back.
4. Moving the elements around is a little bit glitchy in the sense, you can't exactly find out where it'll precisely place itself the moment I release the mouse click.
5. Resizing(increasing) the size of the element is only till a certain size. Remove that restriction.

## Features to add
1. Add an export option to export the canvas into a type which can be deployed on github pages.
2. Add a save option for all the changes made in the canvas thereby allowing you to continue from where you last stopped.
3. One divider line to divide the page into different elements.
4. Add icons section to add links wrt Github, Medium, Linkedin, Instagram, Behance and more. Use existing react-icons for the same.
